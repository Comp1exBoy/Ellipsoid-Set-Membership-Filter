Implementation of set membership filter based on high dimensional space ellipsoid calculation

Formula derivation can be found in this paper :
Milanese  M,  Vicino  A.  Estimation  theory  for  nonlinear  models  and  set  membership uncertainty[J]. Automatica, 1991, 27(2): 403-408 

The advantage of set membership filter is that there is no need to model the noise which means the noise only need to be bounded.
However the filter`s performance is not really statisfying in this code.
